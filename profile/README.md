# Moduvo

Moduvo is a collection of open-source tools for Roblox executor development. We're building everything from the UI to the backend and website, all designed to work together cleanly and efficiently.

## What we're working on

- **moduvo-ui** – Tauri-based executor UI  
- **moduvo-backend** – Lightweight auth system with basic key validation  
- **moduvo-website** – Public site for downloads, login, and more  
- **moduvo-functions** – Executor functions
- **moduvo-security** – Shared logic for HWID checks, token validation, and encryption

Our goal is to make an executor setup that’s fast, good-looking, and easy to build on.

## Why?

Right now, there’s no *actual* open-source UI, backend, or site for Roblox executors. Most options are either private, dead, or intentionally obfuscated. We’re building Moduvo to change that—by making something public, usable, and high quality from the start.

## Status

Still early-stage. Things will break. We’re building in public and open to ideas or feedback.

## License

Licenses vary per repo. Check individual folders before using anything commercially.
